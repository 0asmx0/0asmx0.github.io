I define myself as an aspiring and a rookie hacker. Because I'm at the beginning of an amazing journey. In the beginning, I started my journey by googling
"how to be a hacker". Unfortunately, back then, there was no one to guide me and because of the useless sources on the internet, I waste my time too much. "how to be a hacker by using cmd", "how to be an expert hacker(by learning tons of programs without any knowledge)" etc... Whatever, I don't want to be disrespectful. A while later, I started to say things to myself like "I can do a man in the middle attack but I have no idea how this works" and started to realize that something is going seriously wrong. Then I realize that I became a "script kiddie" instead of a white hat hacker.
Then I immediately stopped and dig into programming, low-level stuff, operating systems, networking, etc. Starting to college helped me a lot. Then I started to become a hacker. Finally, I started to watch videos of LiveOverflow on Youtube and his amazing playlist "Binary Hacking" which helped me to solve CTF's. Then I decided to share my journey, writeups, any useful information and be helpful to others like me. If I say something incorrect or if you have any questions, any useful information or experience to share with me, please feel free to contact me from Twitter or Email.
